# Settings

The settings screens in Actual provide you with a number of options for managing the look and feel of your budget along with some more system specific settings.

The Settings screen can be accessed by clicking the down arrow by your budget name or by going, in the sidebar, to More > Settings.

### Encryption

End to End Encryption is not actually available in Actual version 20.10.25, this is due to the way the Sync system was working, we are working on re-enabling this feature and will update this documentation once that is available.

### Export

Actual is local first, with this, it is possible to export your data from Actual, when you do this you will be given a zip file to download which will contain the SQLite database along with your budget.
