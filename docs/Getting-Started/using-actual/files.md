title: 'The File List'

The file list in Actual is where you will find a list of all your available budget files.

Each budget has a status, for example you can see that the budget file is Syncing to the Actual Server as it has a Syncing status on the file entry. 

If the budget didn't have a Syncing status next to it's name, this would be a local only budget, this means that none of the changes you make would be available on any other device other than the one your viewing Actual on right now.

It is possible to create a new budget at any time using the **Create new file** button.
