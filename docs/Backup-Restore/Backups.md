title: 'Backing up your Actual budget'
---

:::note

If your budget is very old, you may have trouble restoring large backups. If you’re encountering this issue, click “Reset Sync” under 'Settings' > 'Show advanced settings' to reset sync, then make the export again. This should reduce the file size.

:::

You can export your data from Actual at any time. To do so,

1. Login to your budget, click 'More' > 'Settings'

   ![](/img/backup-restore/sidebar-settings@2x.png)

2. Scroll down to the Export section and click Export Data

   ![](/img/backup-restore/settings-export.png)

3. Save the file somewhere on your computer - that is it done.

## Manually creating a backup from the desktop app

This will force a backup to be created right now. Do this if you are going to do something that you might want to revert later (and don't want to use [undo](/Getting-Started/tipstricks/#undoredo)).

- Select the **File > Load Backup…** menu item
- Click **Backup Now**
