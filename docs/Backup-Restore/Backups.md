:::note

This only applies to Actual Web

:::

You can export your data from Actual at any time. To do so,
1. Login to your budget, click 'More' > 'Settings'

   ![](/img/backup-restore/sidebar-settings@2x.png)

2. Scroll down to the Export section and click Export Data

   ![](/img/backup-restore/settings-export.png)

3. Save the file somewhere on your computer - that is it done.

## Manually creating a backup from the desktop app

This will force a backup to be created right now. Do this if you are going to do something that you might want to revert later (and don't want to use [undo](/Getting-Started/tipstricks/#undoredo)).

- Select the **File > Load Backup…** menu item
- Click **Backup Now**
