As we step into 2026, it's natural to look back at the year that just passed. While many apps send you a "year in review" at the end of December, we thought it would be fun to create something special for Actual Budget users — a way to reflect on your financial journey throughout 2025.

## Introducing Actual Budget Wrapped 2025

We've built a small web app that helps you visualize your financial story from the past year. [Actual Budget Wrapped 2025](https://wrapped.actualbudget.org) takes your Actual Budget data and transforms it into a personalized financial recap.

Whether you want to see your biggest spending categories, track your income trends, or simply marvel at how many transactions you've managed — this tool gives you a different perspective on your financial data. Sometimes it's helpful to step back and see the bigger picture of where your money went throughout the year.

The app is designed to be simple and privacy-focused. Your data stays in your browser and is processed locally. We don't collect or store any of your financial information — it's just between you and your Actual Budget file.

## Why Reflect?

Looking back at your finances can be eye-opening. Maybe you'll discover patterns you weren't aware of, or perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much progress you've made toward your goals. Maybe you'll spot areas where you can improve, or celebrate wins you've forgotten about.

Personal finance isn't just about numbers on a screen — it's about the choices we make, the goals we set, and the progress we track along the way. Sometimes taking a step back helps us appreciate how far we've come.

So head over to [wrapped.actualbudget.org](https://wrapped.actualbudget.org) and take a few minutes to see your 2025 financial story. We hope it brings you some insights, or at the very least, a moment of reflection as you plan for the year ahead.

Here's to making 2026 another great year for your finances!
