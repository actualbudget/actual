# Reconciliation

Keeping your Actual account ledgers consistent with your bank ledgers is important to maintain a healthy budget and know exactly how much currency is available to spend. Some choose to reconcile monthly, weekly, or even daily. Actual provides the Reconciliation tool to help manage this process.

## Work Flow

When you reconcile, you compare your bank statement, print or online, against Actual's ledger for that account. If you have made transactions in Actual that have not been verified against your bank account the **cleared** flag will be shown in gray (pending). If the transaction is finalized (cleared) on your bank statement, click the gray circle to turn it green. This is a visual indication that the transaction is in both your budget and in your account statement, and they match.

Click on the green balance in the header of the account view to bring two more category balances into view. The **cleared total** only includes transactions that have cleared the bank while the **uncleared total** will represent the transactions you have entered but aren't yet matched to the bank statement.

## Starting the Reconciliation Tool

Click the 🔒 lock icon in the top right-hand corner of the account ledger. Notice that the last time the account was reconciled is shown on hover.

Let's imagine that we have just checked our account balance for our Chase Amazon account and the current balance is 310.80. We enter the balance we want to match into the Reconciliation tool and press **Reconcile**, or

If we use bank sync, the last synced balance will be shown. We can use that balance by clicking the **use last synced total** button.

The tool will tell us exactly what the difference is between the bank statement and our Actual ledger. Now we can check off the gray circles as we match the Actual ledger against the bank ledger and watch the difference come closer to 0 as we change the cleared status of each transaction. In this case, we're looking for transactions that add up to 324.82. This is much easier by looking at the Actual ledger and bank statement side by side to match the transactions.

When the cleared amount of the Actual account ledger and the value you entered into the Reconciliation tool are the same, the tool will let you know that you are reconciled. Click on the **Exit reconciling** button to complete the reconciliation and lock the cleared transactions.

:::warning

If you fail to click the **Exit reconciling** button after the "All reconciled!" message appears, you will not change the status of the cleared transactions to locked.

Of course, there's always the possibility you need to change a locked transaction. You can click on the lock of any transaction to open a dialog to unlock it.

## Using the Reconciliation Tool for Off Budget Asset Tracking

Some people use off budget accounts to track values of assets such as vehicles, real estate, retirement accounts, or other investment accounts or property. The reconciliation tool is useful to update these values as well. Let's say we have a house that was valued at 367,800 but with current changes in the market it is now valued at 385,000. We go to the ledger for the house, choose the reconciliation tool, and enter 385,000 as the new value into the tool.

The tool tells us that we have a gain of 17,200.

We can use the "Create reconciliation transaction" button to easily create a new transaction that brings the value of the account in line with the new valuation.  You should now have a reconciliation tool that is reporting that it is finished and you can enjoy a new higher net worth.
