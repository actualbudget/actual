Sophtron provides bank synchronization services for US and Canadian financial institutions. This guide will help you set up and use Sophtron with Actual Budget.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Sophtron, you will need:

1. An Actual Budget server configured with Sophtron support
2. Access credentials for Sophtron services

### Generate Setup Credentials for Actual

1. Obtain your Sophtron user ID and user key from your Sophtron service provider.

2. These credentials will be required to authenticate and sync your bank accounts through Sophtron.

### Link Accounts with Sophtron

1. Add the link to your accounts in Actual (Existing or New).
   - **_For an existing account, click on that account, select the ... (kebab menu) in the top right, and choose Link Account_**

   - **_To create a new account with bank syncing click on the '+ Add account' link in the left menu at the bottom_**

     ![](/img/connecting-your-bank/connecting-your-bank-02.webp)

2. Select the Link bank account with Sophtron option.

3. Enter your Sophtron credentials when prompted.

4. A Link Accounts box will pop up displaying your available Sophtron accounts. To link a Sophtron account to an Actual account, click the "Setup bank-sync" button in the same row.
   - The "Bank Account To Sync" column contains the names of the accounts found via Sophtron
   - The "Account in Actual" column contains the name of the Actual account it is linked to.
   - You can also click in the "Account in Actual" column, instead of clicking the "Setup bank-sync" button.

5. Either select an existing Actual account to link to, or create a new one.

6. When you've mapped all your accounts that you wish to, click the "Link Account" button.

### Sophtron Considerations

1. Sophtron supports both US and Canadian financial institutions.

2. The frequency and availability of transaction data depends on your financial institution and Sophtron's service configuration.

3. Historical transaction data availability may vary by institution.
