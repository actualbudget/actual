# Reports Dashboards

Actual features a robust report dashboard.
It is here to allow each user to do deep analysis of their transaction data.

A default dashboard is provided to get you aquainted with the capabilities of the Actual reporting system.
The dashboard is fully customizable, with many available reports and widgets.
If one dashboard is not enough, you can make as many dashboards as you like, each with it's own set of reports and widgets.

All of the available reports can be tuned with filters and live or static date ranges.
This flexibility gives each user the tools they need to understand their finances in a very deep, very personal way.

## Cash Flow Graph

Cash flow shows your spending over time. It only looks at budgeted accounts and shows their balance over time, and includes separate income and expense visualizations. It's a quick way to see how your income and expenses affected your available money over time. Your budgeted accounts are considered to be "cash on hand," so this gives you a picture of how available money fluctuates.

## Net Worth Graph

Net worth shows the balance of all accounts over time. Your net worth is all of your cash and assets minus and debts you owe. Net worth shows the balance of all accounts over time, including all of your investments. Your "net worth" is considered to be the amount you'd have if you sold all your assets and paid off as much debt as possible.

## Spending Analysis
