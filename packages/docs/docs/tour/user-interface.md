# User Interface Overview

The user interface is divided into three parts:

Standard on most screens:

- On the left, we have the sidebar, which lets you easily switch between the various views, such as Budget, Reports, and Accounts.
- The server and sync status (if used) are shown in the red box in the upper right corner.
- The content of the rest of the interface depends on the functionality you have chosen in the sidebar. This screenshot shows an example of a Budget view.

## Top Right Corner

- The eye icon will scramble the numbers on the screen. This is useful if you need to report a bug to the Actual team but want to keep your numbers private. There are some caveats to this, so please read the [Scramble and Hide Data](/docs/getting-started/tips-tricks#scramble-and-hide-data) section in the Tips & Tricks guide.
- If clicking on the sync icon, your local file will sync to the server.
- The current text, _Server online_ shows the connection status. Thus, it could easily read _Server offline_ if you are not connected to a server. If you click on this text, you can change your password, sign out of the server or change the server URL.

## The Sidebar

From the sidebar, you have easy access to all Actual's functionality.

- Access to your Budget, Reports and Schedules.
- Less used functions are found under _More_, like managing Payees and Rules; this is where you find the software settings.
- The sidebar also holds all of your accounts, both on budget and off budget; these will display in a list under the heading to which they belong e.g. On budget.

Most of these will we cover later in the tour.
