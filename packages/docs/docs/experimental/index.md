# Experimental Features

It can take a long time to fully develop and test new features.
In order to make development easier, and to allow users to give feedback, Actual has a system of `experimental features`.
These experimental features are generally opt-in.
If the user doesn't opt-in to enabling the feature there will be no change in user experience.

These features are still in active development, and therefore it is highly recommended to have a regular backup if you enable any of these features.

The current list of experimental features are:

- [Budget templates](/docs/experimental/goal-templates)
- [Rule action templating](/docs/experimental/rule-templating)
- Excel formula mode
- Currency Support
- [Crossover Report](/docs/experimental/crossover-point-report)
- [Pluggy.ai](/docs/experimental/pluggyai)
- [End of Month Cleanup](/docs/experimental/monthly-cleanup)
