The Budget Analysis is a financial planning tool, inspired by the **Cash Flow** report. It tracks your budgets over time. For any given month, the report starts with the previous month's balance and adding the amount budgeted (and spent) for each category during the month.
Like **Cash flow**, it includes separate visualizations for the amount budgeted and expenses, as well as the remaining balance within the category.

## How It Works

The balance tracks your budget performance over time. It starts with the previous interval's balance, adds the budgeted amount for the current interval, and subtracts actual spending. A positive balance indicates under-spending while a negative balance shows over-spending.
