<P>
with the exception that all characters that are neither significant
nor shunned will be assigned to DATACHAR.
<H2><A NAME="charset">Character sets</A></H2>
<P>
A character in a base character set is described either by giving its
number in a <i>universal</i> character set, or by specifying a minimum
literal.
The first 65536 character numbers in the <i>universal</i> character
set are assumed to be the same as in Unicode 2.0 (ISO/IEC 10646).
The remaining character numbers can be assigned in any way convenient.
<P>
The public identifier of a base character set can be associated
with an entity that describes it by using a
<SAMP>PUBLIC</SAMP>
entry in the catalog entry file.
The entity must be a fragment
of an SGML declaration
consisting of the
portion of a character set description,
following the DESCSET keyword,
that is, it must be a sequence of character descriptions,
where each character description specifies a described character
number, the number of characters and
either a character number in the universal character set, a minimum literal
or the keyword
<SAMP>UNUSED</SAMP>.
Character numbers in the universal character set can be as big as
99999999.
<P>
In addition OpenSP has built in knowledge of many character sets.
These are identified using the designating sequence in the
public identifier.  The following designating sequences are
recognized:
<DL>
<DT>
<SAMP>ESC 2/5 4/0</SAMP>
<DD>
The full set of ISO 646 IRV.
This is not a registered character set,
but is recommended by ISO 8879 (clause 10.2.2.4).

<H2>Concrete syntaxes</H2>
<P>
The public identifier for a public concrete syntax can be associated
with an entity that describes using a
<SAMP>PUBLIC</SAMP>
entry in the catalog entry file.
The entity must be a fragment of an SGML declaration
consisting of a concrete syntax description
starting with the
<SAMP>SHUNCHAR</SAMP>
keyword
as in an SGML declaration.
The entity can also make use of the following extensions:
<UL>
<LI>
The Extended Naming Rules extensions can be used regardless of the minimum
literal used in the SGML declaration.
<LI>
An
<I>added function</I>
can be expressed as a parameter literal
instead of a name.
<LI>
The replacement for a reference reserved name
can be expressed as a parameter literal instead of a name.
<LI>
The total number of characters specified for
<SAMP>UCNMCHAR</SAMP>
or
<SAMP>UCNMSTRT</SAMP>
may exceed the total number of characters specified for
<SAMP>LCNMCHAR</SAMP>
or
<SAMP>LCNMSTRT</SAMP>
respectively.
Each character in
<SAMP>UCNMCHAR</SAMP>
or
<SAMP>UCNMSTRT</SAMP>
which does not have a corresponding character in the same position in
<SAMP>LCNMCHAR</SAMP>
or
<SAMP>LCNMSTRT</SAMP>
is simply assigned to <SAMP>UCNMCHAR</SAMP> or <SAMP>UCNMSTRT</SAMP>
without making it the upper-case form of any character.
<LI>
Within the specification of the short reference delimiters,
a parameter literal containing exactly one character
may be followed by the delimiter <SAMP>-</SAMP>
and another parameter literal containing exactly one character.
This has the same meaning as a sequence of parameter literals
one for each character number that is greater than or equal
to the number of the character in the first parameter literal
and less than or equal to the number of the character in the
second parameter literal.
<LI>
A number may be used as a delimiter in the
<SAMP>DELIM</SAMP>
section with the same meaning as a parameter literal
containing just a numeric character reference with that number.
</UL>
<H2>Capacity sets</H2>
<P>
The public identifier for a public capacity set can be associated
with an entity that describes using a
<SAMP>PUBLIC</SAMP>
entry in the catalog entry file.
The entity must be a fragment of an SGML declaration
consisting of a sequence of capacity names and numbers.
