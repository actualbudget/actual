* Function calls (native hooks)
* Operators: + - / * > < >= <= =
* Queries: from t in transactions select { amount  }
* Types
** Boolean (true / false)
** Integer
** Float
** String
* Variables (only global lookup)

Need a stack to hold temporary values since function calls can be
nested. Instructions:

MOV
CALL
QUERY
BOP
UOP

Registers:

PC
SP
REG1

Query language:

=from transactions
   where
     date >= 20170101 and
     date <= 20170131 and
     category.is_income = 1
   calculate sum(amount)
