    // Dates are hard. We just want to deal with months in the format
    // 2020-01 and days in the format 2020-01-01, but life is never
    // simple. We want to rely on native dates for date logic because
    // days are complicated (leap years, etc). But relying on native
    // dates mean we're exposed to craziness.
    //
    // The biggest problem is that JS dates work with local time by
    // default. We could try to only work with UTC, but there's not an
    // easy way to make `format` avoid local time, and not sure if we
    // want that anyway (`currentMonth` should surely print the local
    // time). We need to embrace local time, and as long as inputs to
    // date logic and outputs from format are local time, it should
    // work.
    //
    // To make sure we're in local time, always give Date integer
    // values. If you pass in a string to parse, different string
    // formats produce different results.
    //
    // A big problem is daylight savings, however. Usually, when
    // giving the time to the Date constructor, you get back a date
    // specifically for that time in your local timezone. However, if
    // daylight savings occurs on that exact time, you will get back
    // something different:
    //
    // This is fine:
    // > new Date(2017, 2, 12, 1).toString()
    // > 'Sun Mar 12 2017 01:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)'
    //
    // But wait, we got back a different time (3AM instead of 2AM):
    // > new Date(2017, 2, 12, 2).toString()
    // > 'Sun Mar 12 2017 03:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)'
    //
    // The time is "correctly" adjusted via DST, but we _really_
    // wanted 2AM. The problem is that time simply doesn't exist.
    //
    // Why is this a problem? Well, consider a case where the DST
    // shift happens *at midnight* and it goes back an hour. You think
    // you have a date object for the next day, but when formatted it
    // actually shows the previous day. A more likely scenario: buggy
    // timezone data makes JS dates do this shift when it shouldn't,
    // so using midnight at the time for date logic gives back the
    // last day. See the time range of Sep 30 15:00 - Oct 1 1:00 for
    // the AEST timezone when nodejs-mobile incorrectly gives you back
    // a time an hour *before* you specified. Since this happens on
    // Oct 1, doing `addMonths(September, 1)` still gives you back
    // September. Issue here:
    // https://github.com/JaneaSystems/nodejs-mobile/issues/251
    //
    // The fix is simple once you understand this. Always use the 12th
    // hour of the day. That's it. There is no DST that shifts more
    // than 12 hours (god let's hope not) so no matter how far DST has
    // shifted backwards or forwards, doing date logic will stay
    // within the day we want.
