# Integration new bank

If the default bank integration does not work for you, you can integrate a new bank by following these steps.

1. Find in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ogpzydzotOltbssrc3IQ8rhBLlIZbQgm5QCiiNJrkyA/edit#gid=489769432) what is the identifier of the bank which you want to integrate.

2. Launch frontend and backend server.

3. In the frontend, create a new linked account selecting the institution which you are interested in.

   This will trigger the process of fetching the data from the bank and will log the data in the backend. Use this data to fill the logic of the bank class.

4. Create new a bank class based on `app-gocardless/banks/sandboxfinance-sfin0000.js`.

   Name of the file and class should be created based on the ID of the integrated institution, found in step 1.

5. Fill the logic of `normalizeAccount`, `normalizeTransaction`, `sortTransactions`, and `calculateStartingBalance` functions.
   You do not need to fill every function, only those which are necessary for the integration to work.

   You should do it based on the data which you found in the logs.

   Example logs which help you to fill:

   - `normalizeAccount` function:

     ```log
     Available account properties for new institution integration {
       account: '{
