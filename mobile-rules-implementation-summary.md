- **Reuses desktop components**: `ConditionExpression` and `ActionExpression` for consistent styling
- Uses the same responsive routing pattern as other mobile pages
- Leverages existing rule utility functions via desktop components
- **Consistent theming**: Uses `theme.pillBackgroundLight` and `theme.pillTextHighlighted` from desktop

- **Dynamic row heights**: Rule rows adjust height based on content for better readability
- **Interactive rules**: Tapping any rule opens the full desktop edit modal (optimized for both short tap and long press)
- **Auto-refresh**: After editing or creating a rule, the list automatically updates with changes
- Clean header with just title and "+" add button (no back button clutter)
- **"+" button functionality**: Opens the real rule creation modal with full editing capabilities
- Smooth scrolling and loading experience
- Consistent with other mobile pages in the app

The implementation provides a solid foundation for mobile rules viewing while maintaining consistency with the existing mobile interface patterns.
