Before pushing code changes or opening a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Check if your branch already has a changelog file in the "upcoming-release-notes" folder.
2. If there is no changelog file for your branch:
   a. Find the number of the most recent (highest-numbered) open issue or pull request on GitHub.
   b. Increment that number by 1. Use this as the filename for your new changelog file.
   c. Create a new markdown file in the "upcoming-release-notes" folder with the following format:

```
---
category: Features OR Maintenance OR Enhancements OR Bugfix
authors: [$GithubUsername]
---

$Description
```

3. Commit the new changelog file.
4. Proceed with your push or pull request.
