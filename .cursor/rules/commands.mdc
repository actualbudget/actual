When running yarn commands - always run them in the root directory. Do not run them in child workspaces.

The following commands can be useful:

- `yarn typecheck` to run typechecker
- `yarn lint` to run the code linter and formatter
- `yarn lint:fix` to fix some of the code lint issues (running this is preferred over `yarn lint`)
- `yarn test` to run all the tests
