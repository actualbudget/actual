Vitest test runner is used for unit tests.

When running unit tests, always include the flag `--watch=false` to prevent watch mode.

To run unit tests for a specific package in the monorepo, use the following command:

`yarn workspace <workspaceNameFromPackageJson> run test <pathToTest>`

Recommendation: Minimize the number of dependencies you mock. The fewer dependencies you mock, the better.
