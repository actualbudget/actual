When running unit tests, always include the flag `--watch=false` to prevent watch mode.

To run unit tests for a specific package in the monorepo, use the following command:

`yarn workspace <workspaceNameFromPackageJson> run test <pathToTest>`

Note: The test runner may be either Vite or Jest, depending on the package. Check the `package.json` file in the relevant package to determine which test runner is used.

Recommendation: Minimize the number of dependencies you mock. The fewer dependencies you mock, the better.
