This PR adds support for reading the OpenID client secret from a file using the ACTUAL_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE environment variable. This enables better handling of secrets in Docker and Kubernetes environments.

If both ACTUAL_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET and ACTUAL_OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE are set, the _FILE variant takes precedence.
