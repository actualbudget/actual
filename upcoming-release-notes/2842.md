This enhances the capability to use autocomplete for languages that use accents like Portuguese.
For example, you may have a category that has accents, but currently it will match only when you type the accent in the search string. That seems minimal, but it gets frustrating at some point.

This PR address this quality of life. When searching, it will match if you do not type the accent, and vice-versa.
