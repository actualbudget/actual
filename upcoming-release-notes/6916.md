Add a simple new template type (AddTemplate) to increase the existing category budget value by the template amount every time the "Overwrite with budget template" is run. This solves a particular template issue for people paid more than once per month, for example with fortnightly pays, once the income is deposited to an account, the templates can be run to automatically add the fortnightly spend to each category.
