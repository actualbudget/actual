fix: Fixed a bug where renaming a Budget View would prevent creating categories with the old view name

Previously, when renaming a Budget View from name A to B, the old name A wasn't properly cleaned up from the internal view mappings. This could prevent creating new categories with name A, even though Budget View names shouldn't constrain category names. This fix ensures proper cleanup of old view names when renaming Budget Views.
