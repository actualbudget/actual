Add 'contains' and 'does not contain' operators for payee rule conditions.

Users can now create rules that match payee names by substring rather than exact match. This is particularly useful when:

- Bank imports include varying transaction IDs in payee names (e.g., "Merchant #12345", "Merchant #12346")
- You want a single rule to apply to multiple variations of the same merchant
- You need more flexible payee matching without using complex regex patterns

Example use case: A rule with condition "payee contains 'Amazon'" will match transactions from "Amazon Store #12345", "AMAZON Prime", "amazon.com", etc.

The comparison is case-insensitive and works with the actual payee name displayed in transactions.

**To use this feature:**
1. Go to More > Rules > Create new rule
2. Add a condition with field "payee"
3. Select "contains" or "does not contain" from the operator dropdown
4. Enter the text to match against payee names
5. Add actions as usual (set category, etc.)
6. Save the rule

This enhancement addresses the issue where incrementing merchant transaction IDs created too many distinct payees, making rule management inefficient.
