Added TypeScript types for transaction imports

Added TypeScript type definitions for the `importTransactions` API method and introduced a new `Transaction` interface. This change:

- Adds strict typing for `importTransactions` parameters
- Documents all possible fields for transaction imports
- Makes it easier to understand what fields are required vs optional when importing transactions

This is a non-breaking change that improves type safety and developer experience when working with transaction imports.
