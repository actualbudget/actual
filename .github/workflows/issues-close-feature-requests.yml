            This repository uses lodash style issue management for enhancements. That means enhancement issues are automatically closed. This doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt accept feature requests, though! We will consider implementing ones that receive many upvotes, and we welcome contributions for any feature requests marked as needing votes (just post a comment first so we can help you make a successful contribution).

            The enhancement backlog can be found here: https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues?q=label%3A%22needs+votes%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+

            Don‚Äôt forget to upvote the top comment with üëç!
