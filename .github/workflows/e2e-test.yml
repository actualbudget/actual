            :wave: Looks like VRT (visual regression tests) are failing in this PR. This indicates a problem in the app. It could be either a bug in this PR or a visual change introduced by changing something.

            To fix this: please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/blob/master/packages/desktop-client/README.md#visual-regression) and review the output of the failing CI job to see the generated screenshots.

            We look forward to reviewing this PR once all the CI jobs have passed successfully!
