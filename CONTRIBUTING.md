## Expectations

For smaller improvements or features - feel free to submit a PR or an issue if you don't have the necessary skills to build it yourself. For larger features we would recommend first opening an issue to discuss it with the team.

We aren't going to take every single little change. Don't be offended if we close your PR. In order for the project to stay healthy, we need to guard our bandwidth and also only take changes that align with Actual.

Here are some initial guidelines for how contributions will be treated:

- The mental health of the maintainers will be prioritized above all else. If this means some things get lost and PRs are unreviewed because maintainers are spending time with family or on themselves, we celebrate that.

- Multiple maintainers are key to this being a healthy project. Currently a few people have maintainer rights (see list below). We are actively looking for more people to come on as maintainers. If nobody steps up, expect less activity on this project.

- An open PR does not automatically deserve time for a full review and acceptance. It's up to the PR author to convince the maintainers that the change is good and worth reviewing. This involves a clear description for why the the change is being made, detailing the tradeoffs.

- We especially welcome improvements in automation: creating github actions to automatically generate builds, making the release process easier, etc.

## Project ideas

We welcome all contributions from the community. If you have an idea for a feature you want to build - please go ahead and submit a PR with the implementation or if it's a larger feature - open a new issue so we can discuss it.

If you do not have ideas what to build: the issue list is always a good starting point. Look for issues labeled with "[help wanted](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)".

For first time contributions you can also filter the issues labeled with "[good first issue](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)".
